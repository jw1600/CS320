How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I start with requirements analysis to make sure that every feature originates from clear user needs or system specification documents. Unit testing is conducted at each stage of development to ensure that individual modules function as expected. Then, integration testing is performed after combining the modules to verify that the data flow and interaction logic between them are correct. Finally, input validation is implemented to prevent invalid inputs from causing the system to malfunction.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
In addition to standard client interviews and requirements gathering, I believe the most critical aspect is maintaining continuous communication with the client. After testing at each stage of software design, it is important to discuss the test results with the client and further validate their requirements. This ensures that the overall software design process stays on the right track.
How do I approach designing software?
I start by using requirements analysis to create use case models, then proceed with architecture design, module division, and responsibility assignment. Finally, I carry out database design and interface design.
